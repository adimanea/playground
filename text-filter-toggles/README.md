# Text filter toggles
I need a quick and simple way to filter through a web text I write.
For the time being, I'm satisfied if I:
- have tags/IDs to paragraphs (manually written when writing the article);
- see the tags/IDs as checkboxes at the top of the page;
- check/uncheck the boxes to show/hide that paragraph;
- one extra button to "show all".

More info as I progress with the solution. 
I'm thinking of a simple vanilla Javascript implementation.
