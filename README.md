# My Playground

## Description
Every now and then, I keep getting some ideas or run into problems that
I'd like to solve quickly. Most of the times, they well targeted, i.e.
have a very specific purpose and make a small thing click in my workflow.

For such ideas I started this repository. Therefore, these "toy projects"
will generally not be connected to each other and also not big enough
to be worth their own repository. When and if one matures, it will be
moved separately. Until then, I'll just keep them here and centralize below.

### Text filter toggles
I need a quick and simple way to filter through a web text I write.
For the time being, I'm satisfied if I:
- have tags/IDs to paragraphs (manually written when writing the article);
- see the tags/IDs as checkboxes at the top of the page;
- check/uncheck the boxes to show/hide that paragraph;
- one extra button to "show all".

My attempt(s) [here](text-filter-toggles/README.md).
